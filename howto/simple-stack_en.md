Architecture

## All you get are:
- Amazon RDS leads to server fault tolerance;
- CloudFront leads to high-speed contents delivery;
- Amazon S3 leads to a cost reduction for media storage;

## Need some prior arrangement
- Set up EC2 instance with AMIMOTO AMI
- Set up AWC-CLI on your PC/Mac
- Configure AWC-CLI to control CloundFront from command line

### Launch EC2 instance with AMIMOTO AMI
- On this hands-on, we'll migrate databases, so make sure you're working on develop environment.
- WooCommerce Powered by AMIMOTO (Apache HTTPD PHP7) on AWS Marketplace : https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01DAONMCK/
- AMI fee is free for 14 days (AWS infrastructure charges still apply);


Try one instance of this product for 14 days. There will be no hourly software charges for that instance, but AWS infrastructure charges still apply. Free Trials will automatically convert to a paid hourly subscription upon expiration. Note that Free Trials are only applicable for hourly subscriptions, but you can opt to purchase an annual subscription at any time.


### Set up AWS CLI
Two ways to install AWS CLI: 
- Following AWS User guide:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
- For Mac user install it through package manager Homebrew:
http://brew.sh/index.html

By default, files are extract into below directory:

### Set up IAM for AWS CLI

If you lost them create another user and get another credentials.
- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key

```
If you get no error messages, settings are successfully completed.

### Some set ups to conduct CloudFront through AWC CLI
Basically, AWC CLI disabled CloudFront control. We'll make enable it.

$ aws --profile amimoto  configure set preview.cloudfront true
```

## Add CloudFront to AMIMOTO

- Replace ORIGIN DOMAIN NAME HERE to your domain name of your site for public; 
note: if you have no domain to set, input same values of ORIGIN URL

```
$ export origin_url='{ORIGIN URL}'; export domain='{ORIGIN DOMAIN NAME HERE}'; aws cloudfront create-distribution --cli-input-json "$(curl -l -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amimoto-ami/create-cf-dist-settings/master/source_dist_setting.sh | sh)"
